# magna-mater-milestone-project
User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone project - Code institute

This is a Website built for the swedish rockband Magna Mater
I wanted to make my Milestone Project an actual live site, so i took on my friends band as a client.

Their specifications for the website were that they wanted a new platform to compliment their 
social media accounts with quick overview of uppcomming shows to make it easier to keep track of the band. 
They also wanted a booking function on the site to simplify booking the band.

#### launched at
https://pontushol.github.io/magna-mater/


### UX 

My goal with the design was to make an easily accessable and more or less minimalistic UX while highlighting the visual vibe of the band. 
Using alot of seethrough backgrounds through most sections of the site i hope to highlight the imagery while keeping the information clear and accessable. 

For venues looking to book a show there are links to sample listen the music as well as linked videos of the band playing live shows.
The contact form is easy to access should they want to book a show. 


### Technologies 

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. Bootstrap v 4.3
5. Adobe XD for mockups


### Features

Navbars - 2 Navbars are featured on the site, one bootstrap nav fixed top and a simple bar on the top display to quickly access which 
part of the site you wish to access directly as you get to the site.

Scrolling - The site uses the CSS Scroll-behavior function to makes the transitions using the nav-links smooth and user friendly.


#### Features left to implement

The Contact modal is yet to be linked to an actual email but will be linked shortly.

There is also some content missing in the Band section as im waiting for short Bios from the group, i will sit down with the band 
this week for short interviews and add the bios when im happy with the creative writing part of it. 


### Testing 

The site reaches the standards i was aiming for.
Its easily navigated and features the most important information regarding the near future to draw attention and to promote the uppcomming events further.
It also meets expectations towards potential venues with samples, fotos and information about the band and their music. 

For now, the contact form does not send anything but the modal works propperly across browsers and devises tested. 

The Scroll behaviour falls short on both Microsoft Edge and Safari as it lacks browser support. I do plan on finding a JS 
solution instead of the css one but i still lack the skill to write it. 
on other browsers however, clicking the nav links scrolls the user smoothly through the diffrent sections. 
On the browsers on supported, it simply jumps. 

The Youtube modals works as intended, however sometimes on mobilescreens the fullscreen-mode fails to tilt when the phone is tilted.
I have yet to discover why, as it sometimes do work. 

All links linking to external sites use the "Target="_blank"" function to open social media and the shop in new tabs.
